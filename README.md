# Celebration Timeline

View all the endless upcoming parties and celebrations you have been invited to ðŸ˜Ž, visualised on a timeline. This responsive component was built in React using Typescript with Tailwind for styling, which I find often speeds up the development process and also makes it fun!

## Next Steps
I would like the develop the ability to add your own parties to the timeline, categorise them and integrate it more realistically into a larger app.

## Get Started

1. Clone the repo.
2. ```npm install``` the dependencies.
3. ```npm start``` to get going!
